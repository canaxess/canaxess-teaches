# Identifying the conversation #
This video shows you how to make the conversation identifiable using the `aria-label` attribute, and how the label is enhanced by providing a timestamp of when the message was received.

Screen reader users may use the chatbot in a non-visual way and each conversation block must be identifiable, is each message spoken by the bot or the user. Providing a label of who spoke and the time they spoke provides greater context for screen reader users.
