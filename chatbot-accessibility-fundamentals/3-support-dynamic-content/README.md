# Support for dynamic content #
This video shows you how to support dynamic content using an `aria-live` attribute and understand how to prioritise the announcing of messages using the values of **polite** or **assertive**. 

Screen reader users navigate onscreen content audibly. If parts of the screen change visually, we need to ensure the change is identifiable programmatically as well. By making a change programmatically identifiable the screen reader monitors what has changed and announces the change audibly.
