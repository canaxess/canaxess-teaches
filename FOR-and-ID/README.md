# Link labels to form controls using the FOR and ID attributes

In this lesson you will learn to link a label to a form control using the `FOR` and `ID` attributes. We will confirm the link is correctly established by clicking the label element and viewing the accessibility tree in Chrome developer tools.

## Background

Navigating a page visually allows relationships between labels and controls to be understood, but if visual navigation is difficult this relationship is no longer effective. The `FOR` and `ID` attributes provide a programmatic link between the label and form control allowing a screen reader user to understand the type of data a control requires. 

When a label is programmatically linked to a form control, the screen reader will use the label to provide an audible prompt to the user.
