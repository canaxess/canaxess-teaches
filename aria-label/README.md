Sometimes it's difficult to have a visible label which is programmatically linked to an input control, for times like this we need to look at aria attributes which can be used to provide a programmatic label for the input control.

## Background

Navigating a page visually allows relationships between labels and controls to be understood, but if visual navigation is difficult this relationship is no longer effective. The `aria-label` attribute provides a programmatically assigned label to the input control allowing a screen reader user to understand the type of data a control requires. 

## Prerequisites

Google Chrome is the preferred browser.
